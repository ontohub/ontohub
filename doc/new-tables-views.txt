Ontohub: new tables and views

existing tables
---------------
ontologies
* show local theory by default, button for showing flattened theory
* translate ontology to different language
* for distributed ontologies, show members
* divide sentence numbers into axioms, theorems and goals
* adding new axioms + goals
* check consistency (via Hets)
* union of n ontologies
* filter by logic/language
* class graph (see Bioportal)
ontology_versions
links
* CRUD + ownership
* show ontology graph, say, up to three links from the current ontology (larger diameters may be input by the user). Use graphviz/svg
* check conservativity (via Hets)
link_versions
sentences

* for goals, add prove + disprove buttons (via Hets)
