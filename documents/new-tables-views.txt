Ontohub: new tables and views

crucial prerequisites:
* repair new model branch, Henning, Daniel  
* read in DGXML (produced by Hets) #55 Julian, Till (example needed)
* read in Ontohub registry (RDF) #62
* display graphs (e.g. via graphviz) #63

existing tables
---------------
ontologies
* show local theory by default, button for showing flattened theory
* translate ontology to different language
* for distributed ontologies, show members
* divide sentence numbers into axioms, theorems and goals
* adding new axioms + goals
* check consistency (via Hets)
* union of n ontologies
* filter by logic/language
* class graph (see Bioportal)
ontology_versions
links
* CRUD + ownership
* show ontology graph, say, up to three links from the current ontology (larger diameters may be input by the user). Use graphviz/svg
* check conservativity (via Hets)
link_versions
sentences
* show proof status and basic_proofs
* for goals, add prove + disprove buttons (via Hets)

new tables
----------
logics
* CRUD + ownership + supports relation
logic_mappings
* CRUD + ownership + logic_adjoints
* show logic graph (and interesting subgraphs)
languages
* CRUD + ownership + supports relation
language_mappings
* CRUD + ownership + language_adjoints
* show language graph (and interesting subgraphs)
serializations
* CRUD + onwership
basic_proofs
* show, including uses sentences
structured_proofs
* show, including parts
