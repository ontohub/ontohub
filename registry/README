This directory holds a preliminary implementation of the OntoIOp registry, comprising non-exhaustive descriptions of the following things conforming with DOL:

* logics
* ontology languages
* serializations of ontology languages
* logic translations (a.k.a. "ontology language translations")

The registry is implemented as an RDF dataset, using the ontology language description vocabulary found in ../syntax.

If you are reading this file in the public OntoIOp WebDAV repository, and not in the OntoIOp development Subversion repository, some files may be missing.

* registry.turtle: the primary implementation (Turtle syntax)
* registry.rdf: the same exported to RDF/XML
* registry-expanded.turtle: an expanded version of the original dataset, after applying the inference rules
