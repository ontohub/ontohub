The material in this directory is for maintaining the persistent URLs (PURLs).

At http://purl.net there is a user group "ontoiop", currently administered by Christoph Lange (user ID "clange").

Use the following scripts for maintenance:
* sendbatchpurls.pl for batch-uploading (i.e. creating new PURLs)
* modifybatchpurls.pl for batch-modifying existing PURLs

The following files describe the PURLs to be uploaded/modified:
* dol-purls.xml – the PURLs relevant for DOL (to be written)
* purl-batch.rng – the Relax NG grammar of the XML file
