A web-based repository for distributed ontologies, models and specifications.

An ontology is a formal, logic-based description of the concepts and
relationships that are of interest to an agent (user or service) or to a
community of agents. The conceptual model of an ontology reflects a consensus,
and the implementation of an ontology is often used to support a variety of
applications such as web services, expert systems, or search engines. Therefore,
ontologies are typically developed in teams. Ontohub wants to make this
step as convenient as possible. Besides ontologies, Ontohub also
supports formal models and specifications, or more generally,
logical theories.

Ontohub aims at satisfying a subset of the requirements for an Open Ontology
Repository (OOR) and is being developed in close donnection with the Distributed
Ontology, Modeling and Specification Language (DOL), which is part of the emerging Ontology, Model and Specification Integration and
Interoperability standard (OntoIOp) at OMG.  For more
information from this perspective, see [the Ontohub home page](http://ontoiop.org).

This application started at the compact course [agile web development][0] given
by [Carsten Bormann][1] at the University of Bremen in March, 2012. The
concept and assignment came from [Till Mossakowski][2], now in Magdeburg [3]
and [Christoph Lange][4].

Initial developers are [Julian Kornberger][5] and [Henning Müller][6].

Documentation generated with yard is to be found on
[rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/github/ontohub/ontohub/frames).

Installation
------------

A guide to set up your own instance of ontohub you can find in the [deployment guide][7].

Also a guide for development environment for [Mac][8] and [Ubuntu][9]
in the Wiki.
